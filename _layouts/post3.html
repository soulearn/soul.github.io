    Engineering - a course which is apparently one of the most sought after courses for the people who want to live their life to the fullest and have a balance between academics and fun. I entered MCE with a lot of hopes. I wanted to find new friends, become a part of a club, participate in events and so much more. I wanted to experience everything that I had only heard of till then. But never had I imagined that I would be a part of an organization like SoUL. With a simple, yet motivating motto of 'Educating minds, Empowering lives', SoUL has attracted towards it a number of like minded people who wish to contribute to the society. I too, like all those people, wanted to join SoUL. 
I went for the audition after asking a senior about it. Unaware of the type of questions I was about to be asked, I entered the canteen where the auditions were taking place. As they called me for the audition, I went near the table, where everyone had taken seats around a chair which was basically meant for the one about to give an audition. I sat there as everyone started asking questions. I replied with answers that I felt were appropriate. I still remember trying to put into a decent tune the very famous formula of e=mc2. I remember trying to convince that one senior who pretended to be a kid to give up on an India Pakistan match for a grammar class though I don't know if I really succeeded in it. After an audition which continued for around 15-20 minutes I walked out of the canteen, not sure if I would be selected but wanting to be selected. After waiting for a day or two I got my confirmation message. I jumped in joy as I saw that message. Finally a SoUL'ian! (a volunteer though) 
My first session is something I'll remember all my life. The session that stared with a "What is your name? " and ended with a number of handshakes and "Bye Akka". The session where I entered the Balmandir empty handed but left with many paper planes and butterflies in my hands.
Time flies. I got into SoUL in the month of February. It was August already. The weekend sessions in Balmandir were on full swing. It was then that we planned to make Thank you cards. Thanking people for what they do every day is something we seldom do. When the idea of giving the policemen, fire brigadiers and the drivers of ambulances 'Thank you cards' on Independence Day popped up, everyone started working to put the plan into action. The smiles on the faces of everyone who received the cards said it all. It wasn't something they were expecting. But it definitely was something that made their day.
We continued with our sessions for the remaining months of that semester. And then, our odd semester came to an end. 
As our even semester began, we started our weekend sessions are well. Just a few days into the even semester and the posters of Malnad fest glistened in the whole college. Malnad fest witnessed our fundraising event. My first fundraising event where we sold juice, to collect funds that we required for our sessions and drives. 'Kokum' did the magic for us. With appreciation (and donations) from people who came to buy the juice, our event ended up being a successful one. 
And after a very long vacation of 2 and a half months, we returned to college. Just when we were planning to conduct a drive for the less privileged ones of the society, we were enthralled by the decorations for the carnival, Jamboree. During Jamboree, we conducted cloth drive and book drive where we collected old clothes and old books with unused pages from MCEians. The response we received from the students and staff of MCE was appreciable. The books found their place in the bags of children of Government schools and the clothes comforted the needy who shivered in the streets of Hassan. 
As a SoULian, the celebration of festivals has taken a turn in my life. The festival of lights and colors, Diwali and Holi found a new definition, "the festival of happiness" as we celebrated them with the kids in Balmandir. Be it Ganesh Chaturthi or Ramzan, we all celebrated with the kids in Balmandir with the same enthusiasm. The glee that kids felt when we celebrated the festivals together showed through their twinkling eyes and bright smiles. 
Our happiness doubled during SoUL Day. The day which is no less than a festival to any of us in SoUL and Balmandir. The 2 days filled with happiness whose memories make an impact on the kids as well as SoULians. The day which teaches us to compete and enjoy. 
It's been a year now, since I became a part of this wonderful organization. Over the months, SoUL has transformed me as a person. It has taught me that "Service is not a favor to the have not's, it's a responsibility of the have's ". I still remember my dad saying, "You'll be teaching the kids? You'll be fine? I don't think it's an easy of a task. What will you teach? " as he laughed at me. To be frank, even I wasn't sure. I wasn't sure if I could teach them well. Well enough for them to feel the urge to study. But one thing was for sure, I wouldn't give up on this. Definitely not. Every time I enter the Balmandir, there is a very strange thing I notice. I go there to teach the kids what I know. But return with something that makes me feel better about myself. There is this strange satisfaction. Well maybe that's exactly what we are all here for in SoUL. Because it's not the appreciation we long for, it's the satisfaction. </p>
