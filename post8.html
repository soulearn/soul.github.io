			As Engineering gives you much time and freedom to get involved in extracurricular activities apart from studies, I too was intended to do something different. 1st year of engineering was almost spent in the excitement of getting into engineering.  It's 2nd year! while some people depict it as ‘the making of an engineer’ begins from here, I was so keen in getting into different zone. Then heard the name ‘SoUL’ from one of my seniors explaining about the auditions in the class. The idea was just brilliant and I too was one among those eagerly waiting to join into it. Some of the seniors of different club were seen under the lights of creating this beautiful unit ‘SoUL’ giving a unique definition in the name itself as ‘So U Learn’! Although I was part of this organization for a very limited period of time, my life was sparkled with the smiles of the children that I used to meet every weekend in balmandir. Initially the task of teaching the kids beyond the restricted syllabus looked pretty easy, became challenging yet interesting when it comes to reaching the subject to the students. To have a clear enforcement of the topics, we made sub-groups to mentor them and concentrate on individuals separately. We even made sure to have an annual day called ‘SoUL day’ just like schools in the town. For all these events the funds were raised in an unique manner. After all the efforts put by us, the response from the children were priceless both in the aspects of SSLC board results and a huge smile that we used to get after every sessions made our lives fill up with lifetime satisfaction and memories. Other fascinating activities like cloth drive, food drive etc.. were undertaken to help the people who are in need. Unfortunately I could not continue in the later part of engineering journey due to personal reasons making way for time. So If u have enough time and love to work in these activities, then ‘SoUL’ is the way to go. But make sure that you have enough time so that you won’t leave it in the middle and regret it later. People can even help by donating the required things for the cause without being a member of the organization too. At last I wish these efforts should be never ending…</p>
