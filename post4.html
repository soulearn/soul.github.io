          <p>It was a cold chilly night in November when I was not wrapped up in my bed sleeping but at my office, in my night shift... </p>
<p>The quick transition from college to corporate life had frozen the impulsive instincts in me. Four to five of us were in shift and when the work load was a bit down we grabbed some snacks and sat down to tell our college stories to each other.It all had band, dance troups, DJs, trips, IVs, parties, long drive, etc.I had all of the above as well.. but I had something to share..that I was so damn proud of. I was part of a SoUL that lit a bunch of little minds.When Keerthesh called me and spoke about starting SoUL over our canteen Chai.. the level of anxiety I faced was beyond compare!!!We are actually starting something new, something worthy, something as satisfying as a perfectly smooth sphered icecream ball!!SoUL was formed keeping in mind our balmandir kids knowing that they aren't just some random bunch of school kids, but very very special of their kind.Of how not the stereotype kind of kids they are.. and how beautiful they had build their world within the four walls of Balmandir something we, the soulmates found very fascinating to colour.Even the dominos pizza guy wouldn't have the kind of welcoming face the kids had when we entered Balmandir for the very first time!!We were instantly akkandiru and annandiru for them!!!!And all in chorus told "namge paata helkkodakke bandidare".When Rafiq sir asked them why are we here.Assuming they are kids extremely enthusiastic to learn.. we started off grouping them in teams and sorting them into teams from L1-L3 based on the kind of existing knowledge they possess and ability to grasp things.</p>

<p>That was the kick start of everything and then every Sunday was a roller coaster learning ride for us so we learnt to ask all that doubts you failed to ask your teacher once when you were a kid..</p>
<ul>
 <li> why "I" and "eye" had different spelling and why elephant doesn't start with the letter a.</li>
<li>To ask "may I go to washroom" every 5 min hiding any kind of naughty facial expressions like a pro.</li>
<li> To have a stomach pain that exists in the entire study session and vanishes immediately during the activity time!!</li>
<li>To colur the leaf blue and the sky green with utmost confidence and basically to give your favorite color to the world you draw.</li>
<li>To compete even with your best friends with utmost sportsmanship.</li>
<li>To be as crazy as possible and not care. </li>
<li>To sing out loud  and dance like none's watching at any given opportunity.</li></ul>

<p>This is just an epilogue about my SoUL family.And I do not intend to end it in a single note.There's lot more to come...brace yourselves.</p>
