           Once when I was roaming around the college campus, one of the seniors from our branch approached me. He asked me if I had any old books which could be helpful for small kids. I told him â€œyes I have some" and asked "why are you collecting these kind of stuff?"
It was then I heard about a student organisation 'SoUL'. A voluntary student organisation, which believes service is not a favor to the have-nots, but is a responsibility of the haves.

He told me that he was one of the volunteers in SOUL and they're conducting a 'BOOK DRIVE' to help the kids in need. Next he went on narrating their whole activity. In the meantime he told me, "We are teaching small children who need nurturing in studies." That particular thing inspired me to join their team of volunteers.

With some of the horrible experiences of audition in our college, I went in front of the senior members of the organisation. But actually the audition turned into a healthy discussion about my opinion on current education system, social service and other things related to the vision of SoUL.

I still remember the first session which I had attended. When I entered Balmandir with my friends, I got introduced to a group of 60 to 70 children. The interest of those kids towards learning English set a spark inside me. At that time I realised, what actually sharing happiness is. When we serve the society selflessly, it makes us happy at the end of the day.

Most of the people measure success in terms of money, education, status etc. But at the end of the day if you are able to create happiness in one's life, then you are really successful. The secret of success lies in small things which you share with others. That's the lesson I have learnt from my team.</p>
