Ode to those days where summer holidays were an outdoor thing and our phones didn't satisfy all our needs of entertaining us for the whole day.
And worst of all  we had holidays for three whole months and didn't know how to kill time.. 
Then was the time where we were just a team and loved spending time together...
On one of our regular tea meetings there came a voice "enara madana kanro independence day ge"!! 
And we came up with a brainstorming session on what could be done and how to fund them.
The time Ustaad hotel was seen by most kannadigas and they all were severely inspired by the motto the movie gave up.
That food is the only thing the mankind can say "enough" to!
Keeping this in a corner of  our heads, by another two three rounds of teas and masala toasts, we decided on a food drive.. where we would ride all around the city and give food packets for the people in need.. for independence day was a celebration of freedom and it becomes meaningless when the city is still sleeping hungry . 
We emptied out our pockets and were sure that would not fill our own tummies. 
So we set out figuring out ways to gather funds and we set out on a free juice campaign where we would give fresh juice to the ones coming for walking and jogging in the ring road of Hassan and enlighten them about our plans and receive any kinds of possible support from them.
And we set out everyday at 5 and planted our stalls in ring road and stadium and let people know  by the end of day 3 we had two Viva bottles worth funds.
And then this person, Mr.Sathyanarayana was very enthusiastic in what we were doing and decided to sponsor the entire lunch for 150 people. 
This puzzled us in ways words can't define!! 
And the collected funds were put on the breakfast so that we have a good start for the day  along with them and they didn't have to fill their stomachs with sweets from flag hoisting.

After a sleepless night of immense curiosity and anxiety of what would happen the next day...
We set off to Bantus home and set our unit on his dining table with a big three pots full of food  which were refilled as and when it got over.
While some of us stood in the unit filling food packets, the rest had them supplying all around the city.
From parks to roadsides to temple verandas, we went around and round and gave off every packet we had. 
The smiles we got were priceless.
This being the first drive we ever did, this pushed us on to be a lot impulsive that dragged us to do so many similar things.</P>

"Why this line?", you may think. "Why not?", was our thought. As the chilling nights of Hassan kept us shivering even with thermals and jackets on, we couldn't help but think about the plight of the ones who lived their life struggling in the tents. The ruthless winters of Hassan had no mercy on them. After countless ideas which didn't seem to work, the idea of 'Cloth drive' came up which went on to do wonders. The counter which was put up for the people to donate clothes during Jamboree witnessed donation in an extremely good number. The satisfaction we SoULians felt when the clothes comforted the people who needed them the most was unexplainable.</P>

Our generation has seen the transformation taking place. But we all know that there is nothing that can replace books in the primary stages of our education. We knew that a bundle of pages could realize someone's dream and help build someone's life. With the keen observation of a few and experience of others, we decided to collect books with unused pages from students of our college. Little did we know that it would turn out so well. Hundreds of books were collected with lots of unused pages present in each of them. As we worked together to separate the unused pages from the books and bind them to make new ones, we knew that it was going to be worth it. Our instincts were proved right when the glee that the kids felt as they received the books reflected in their eyes and smiles.</P>
